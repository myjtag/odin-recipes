    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Roman pasta dish known for its silky, creamy sauce made without cream—just eggs,
        cheese, and pasta water. Crispy guanciale (or pancetta) adds salty richness, while black pepper brings a gentle
        heat. It's quick, elegant, and incredibly satisfying.</p>
    <p>The magic lies in the emulsion of starchy pasta water with egg yolks and cheese, creating a velvety coating that
        clings perfectly to the spaghetti. Ready in under 30 minutes, it's perfect for weeknight dinners or a late-night
        craving. Serve with extra cheese and pepper for pure indulgence!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) guanciale or pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>100g (1 cup) Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated (plus extra for serving)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until al dente according to package
            instructions.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook the guanciale or pancetta until crispy and golden,
            about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, grated Pecorino, and plenty of freshly ground black pepper until
            smooth.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Add the hot spaghetti to the skillet with the guanciale over low heat. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat. Quickly pour in the egg mixture and toss vigorously, adding reserved pasta
            water a splash at a time until a creamy sauce forms (it should coat the pasta without scrambling the eggs).
        </li>
        <li>Season with more pepper and salt if needed. Serve immediately with extra cheese.</li>
    </ol>
