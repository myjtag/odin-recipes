    <h1>Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../img/chicken.jpg" alt="Rich and creamy homemade Chicken Tikka Masala">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a beloved curry featuring tender marinated chicken pieces in a vibrant, spiced
        tomato-cream sauce. Fragrant with garam masala, ginger, and garlic, it's mildly spicy, creamy, and utterly
        addictive.</p>
    <p>The chicken is first marinated in yogurt and spices, then grilled or broiled for smoky flavor before simmering in
        the luxurious sauce. Serve over basmati rice with naan bread—it's restaurant-quality comfort food made at home!
    </p>
