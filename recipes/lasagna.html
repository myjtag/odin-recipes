    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagne is a timeless Italian comfort dish that's ideal for cozy family meals or impressing guests. This homemade
        version layers silky pasta sheets with a hearty meat sauce made from ground beef, tomatoes, and fragrant herbs,
        topped with creamy béchamel and bubbling mozzarella cheese. It's rich, satisfying, and full of flavor in every
        bite!</p>
    <p>What sets this lasagne apart is the perfect harmony of textures—the tender noodles, savory ragu, and gooey cheese
        melt together in the oven to create a golden, crispy top. Prep it ahead and bake when ready; it even freezes
        beautifully for busy nights. Pair it with a crisp salad and crusty bread for the ultimate feast!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagne sheets (no-boil or fresh)</li>
        <li>500g (1 lb) ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, finely diced</li>
        <li>800g (28 oz) canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>200ml (¾ cup) red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>250ml (1 cup) beef stock</li>
        <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Olive oil for cooking</li>
        <li>50g (3½ tbsp) butter</li>
        <li>50g (⅓ cup) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>750ml (3 cups) whole milk</li>
        <li>A pinch of nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g (10 oz) mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>100g (1 cup) Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook
            for 5-7 minutes until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon, and
            cook until browned. Drain excess fat if needed.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it simmer until
            mostly evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, beef stock, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat
            to low and let the sauce cook uncovered for 45-60 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, make the béchamel: Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the
            flour and cook for 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until
            thickened (coats the back of a spoon), about 8-10 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagne in a large baking dish (9x13 inches): Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.
            Add a layer of lasagne sheets. Spread meat sauce, then béchamel, and sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan.
            Repeat layers (usually 3-4 layers total), finishing with béchamel and a generous topping of cheeses.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden and
            bubbling.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagne rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
